## What is Frontend Development? 

Frontend Development is essentially the stuff you see. It's also known as client-side development. It deals with the stuff that the average user will be interacting with. The applications, the user-interface, the text- I think you get the idea. The challenge with client-side development is developing an easy to use format, application, and user-interface (essentially anything the user actively interacts with) that anyone can easily interact with and use.
